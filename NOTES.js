// *** Preventing Injection Attacks ***

//don't do this! it is vulnerable, anybody can look at req.body or sign in as an admin.
app.post("/users", async (req, res, next) => {
  let newUser = await User.create(req.body);
  res.json(newUser);
});

//instead do this! (destructure the request body to only contain the pertinent info and hide it from malicious intentions)
app.post("/users", async (req, res, next) => {
  let { name, password, address } = req.body;
  let newUser = await User.create({ name, password, address });

  res.json(newUser);
});

// *** Authorization via Express Gates ***

//Authentication == "who am I?"
//Authorization = "am I allowed to be here?"

//n-ary functions can take 1 or many callbacks.

//before the below GET routes, install a GATE that only allows the requests after confirming admin status.

const isAdmin = (req, res, next) =>
  req.user.isAdmin ? next() : res.send("none shall pass");
//gate ^^^

//dependency injection design pattern
app.get("/secrets", async (req, res, next) => {
  let creditCards = await Secrets.findAll();
  res.send(creditCards);
});

app.get("/corporate-data", async (req, res, next) => {
  let marketingData = await MarketingData.findAll();
  res.send(marketingData);
});

//Exercise: how can we extend this pattern to make sure Dan does not have access to Jess' cart?

// *** Hiding Secrets ***

//Instead of this:
app.get("/users", async (req, res, next) => {
  let user = await Users.findByPk(req.params.id); //returns all the user info

  res.json({ user });
});

///Try this:
app.get("/users", async (req, res, next) => {
  let user = await Users.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    include: ["name", "address", "faveIceCream"],
  });

  res.json({ user });
});

//be judicious about what is returned from any get request!
